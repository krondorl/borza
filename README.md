# Borza text editor

This is a work-in-progress (WIP) program following [Kofi Otuo's Medium articles series.](https://medium.com/@otukof/678a463f968b)

The aim of this project is to practice and deepen my Rust language skills.

## Motivation

I always wanted to write my own text editor, but earlier I lacked the expertise or time to do that.

## Features

- CLI text editor
- Written in Rust

## System Requirements

At least Rust version, `rustc 1.74.1`.

You can check with command: `rustc --version`

## Install

You will need the Rust language installed on your computer.

To do so, read the guide on [Install Rust webpage](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Run

Execute: `cargo run`

## Build

To build the optimized version, run: `cargo build --release`

## License
